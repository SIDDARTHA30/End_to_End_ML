# End_to_End_ML

This repository contains my beginner Machine Learning projects.  
In these projects, I practiced the complete ML workflow step by step using Python and Scikit-Learn.

I worked on both **Regression** and **Classification** problems.

## Project 1 : Diabetes Prediction (Regression)

In this project, I used the Diabetes dataset from sklearn to predict diabetes progression.

### What I did in this project
- Imported required libraries (Pandas, Sklearn)
- Loaded the diabetes dataset
- Converted the dataset into a DataFrame
- Performed basic EDA (shape, null values, statistics, duplicates)
- Separated input features (X) and output (y)
- Split data into training and testing (80/20)
- Trained a Linear Regression model
- Predicted results using test data
- Evaluated the model using regression metrics

### Results
- R2 Score : 0.45  
- MAE : 42.79  
- MSE : 2900  
- RMSE : 53.85  

This is a **Regression problem** because the output is a numeric value.

## Project 2 : Breast Cancer Prediction (Classification)

In this project, I used the Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

### What I did in this project
- Loaded the dataset and created a DataFrame
- Checked for missing values and duplicates
- Performed basic EDA
- Separated features and target column
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained Linear Regression (for comparison)
- Trained Logistic Regression (main classification model)
- Predicted results
- Evaluated the model using classification metrics

### Results
- Accuracy : 95%
- Generated Confusion Matrix
- Generated Classification Report

This is a **Classification problem** because the output is a category (0 or 1).
